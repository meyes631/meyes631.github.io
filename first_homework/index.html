        <p align="center">And as we wind on down the road <br>
Our shadows taller than our soul.<br>
There walks a lady we all know<br>
Who shines white light and wants to show<br>
How everything still turns to gold.<br>
And if you listen very hard<br>
The tune will come to you at last.<br>
When all are one and one is all<br>
To be a rock and not to roll.</p>
